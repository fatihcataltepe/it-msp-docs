## Main MSP Service Lines

An MSP typically organizes its business around **4-6 primary service lines**, each with distinct revenue models, profitability profiles, and dedicated teams. Understanding these service lines is critical because each has fundamentally different cost structures, labor requirements, and margins.[1][2][3][4]

### Service Line 1: Managed Services (Proactive Monitoring & Maintenance)

**Definition**: Continuous, 24/7 monitoring and maintenance of client IT infrastructure.[3][4][1]

**Services included**:[5][1][3]
- Network monitoring and management
- Patch deployment and updates
- Antivirus and malware protection
- Backup and verification
- Firewall and security monitoring
- Hardware health monitoring (via RMM)

**Revenue model**: Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) subscription; predictable and scalable.[6][4][1]

**Profitability**: **15-25% margin** (best case); this is the highest-margin service line because revenue grows without proportional labor increases.[2][4][1]

**Typical team allocation**: 40-50% of technical staff
- NOC staff (2-3 people)
- Network engineers (1-2 people)
- Systems administrators (2-3 people)

**Key metric**: Revenue per employee £150-200k (highest efficiency).[1]

### Service Line 2: Professional Services (Project Work & Consulting)

**Definition**: Non-recurring, project-based work that requires specialized expertise.[2][3][1]

**Services included**:[3][1][2]
- Network architecture and design
- Cloud migration consulting
- IT strategy and planning
- On-site project implementation
- System implementation and deployment
- Business continuity planning

**Revenue model**: Time & materials billing or fixed-price project fees; highly variable.[6][1][2]

**Profitability**: **10-15% margin** (lower than managed services because labor costs scale 1:1 with revenue).[1][2]

**Typical team allocation**: 15-20% of technical staff
- Project managers (1-2 people)
- Senior engineers (2-3 people doing design/architecture work)
- Implementation specialists (1-2 people)

**Key metric**: More expensive to deliver; generates revenue but requires active project staffing.[2]

### Service Line 3: Help Desk / Managed Support (Reactive Support)

**Definition**: User-facing, responsive support for end-user technical issues.[7][8][3][1]

**Services included**:[8][3][1]
- Password resets and account management
- Software troubleshooting
- Hardware support (printers, desktops, laptops)
- Remote user support
- On-site break-fix work

**Revenue model**: Often bundled into managed services contract, or charged per-incident (break-fix).[8][1]

**Profitability**: **8-12% margin** if bundled; **5-8% margin** if break-fix (very labor-intensive).[8][1][2]

**Typical team allocation**: 25-35% of technical staff
- Tier 1 helpdesk (8-10 people)
- Tier 2 support engineers (3-5 people)
- Service desk coordinator/dispatcher (1 person)

**Key metric**: Resolution on first contact (ROFC) ≥70%; cost per ticket should be <£50-80.[8]

### Service Line 4: Backup & Disaster Recovery (Data Protection)

**Definition**: Continuous data protection and recovery services.[3][1]

**Services included**:[1][3]
- Automated backup and archival
- Off-site replication
- Disaster recovery testing
- Business continuity planning
- Data restoration services

**Revenue model**: MRR subscription per client or per-GB-stored model.[4][1]

**Profitability**: **18-22% margin** (highly scalable after initial setup; low operational touch).[4][1]

**Typical team allocation**: 5-10% of technical staff
- Backup specialist (0.5-1 person)
- Recovery testing / monitoring (shared with NOC)

**Key metric**: RPO/RTO compliance; test recovery success rate (target: 100%).[2][1]

### Service Line 5: Security & Compliance (Managed Security)

**Definition**: Proactive security monitoring, threat prevention, and compliance management.[9][7][1]

**Services included**:[5][9][1]
- Managed firewall and intrusion prevention
- Managed antivirus and endpoint detection & response (EDR)
- Security awareness training
- Vulnerability assessments and penetration testing
- Compliance auditing (GDPR, ISO 27001)
- Threat monitoring and incident response

**Revenue model**: MRR subscription (often premium pricing due to specialization).[1]

**Profitability**: **20-25% margin** (high perceived value; can command premium pricing).[1]

**Typical team allocation**: 10-15% of technical staff
- Security specialist (1-2 people)
- Compliance officer (0.5 person, shared)
- SOC/SIEM monitoring (often outsourced or part-time)

**Key metric**: Vulnerability detection rate; time-to-respond on threats.[1]

### Service Line 6: Cloud Services & Consulting

**Definition**: Cloud infrastructure management, migration, and optimization.[4][1]

**Services included**:[4][1]
- Cloud migration and deployment (AWS, Azure, M365)
- Cloud cost optimization
- Cloud infrastructure management
- SaaS application integration and support

**Revenue model**: MRR subscription + professional services (migration); high ticket value.[4][1]

**Profitability**: **12-18% margin** (newer market segment; high expertise premium).[4][1]

**Typical team allocation**: 10-15% of technical staff
- Cloud architect (1 person)
- Cloud engineer (1-2 people)
- M365/Azure specialist (1 person)

**Key metric**: Cloud revenue mix target: 4-10% of total revenue (growing).[4][1]

## Service Line Profitability Comparison

This is critical for your MSP business model:

| Service Line | Margin | Revenue Per Employee | Scalability | Labor Intensity | Typical % of Revenue |
|--------------|--------|----------------------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Managed Services** | 15-25% | £150-200k | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | Low | 30-40% |
| **Backup & DR** | 18-22% | £180-220k | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | Low | 6-10% |
| **Security** | 20-25% | £150-180k | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | Medium | 3-8% |
| **Cloud Services** | 12-18% | £140-170k | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ High | Medium | 4-10% |
| **Professional Services** | 10-15% | £120-150k | ⭐⭐ Low | High | 13-15% |
| **Help Desk** | 8-12% | £100-130k | ⭐⭐ Low | High | 25-35% |

**Key insight**: Top-performing MSPs generate **60-70% of revenue from high-margin managed services (MRR)** and only **15-25% from labor-intensive professional services/help desk**.[2][1][4]

## How Team Structure Aligns with Service Lines

For a 30-40 person MSP with £750k EBITDA, typical team organization looks like this:[10][11][12][13][8]

```
CEO/Owner (1)
├─ Operations Director (1)
│  ├─ Help Desk Manager (1)
│  │  ├─ Tier 1 Helpdesk (8-10)
│  │  └─ Tier 2 Engineers (3-5) → Handle security, cloud, projects
│  ├─ Network/Infrastructure Manager (1)
│  │  ├─ Network Engineers (1-2) → Managed Services
│  │  ├─ Backup Specialist (0.5-1) → Backup & DR
│  │  └─ Security Specialist (1) → Security Services
│  ├─ Project Manager (1)
│  │  └─ Implementation/Field Staff (2-3) → Professional Services
│  └─ NOC Lead (shift-based)
│     └─ NOC Technicians (2-3, outsourced common) → Managed Services
├─ Sales & Account Management (2-3)
└─ Finance & Admin (2-3)
```

## Team Staffing by Service Line (30-40 Person MSP)

| Service Line | Dedicated Staff | Cross-Functional | Focus |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Managed Services** | 4-5 (Network, Backup, NOC) | Tier 2 engineers | Proactive monitoring |
| **Help Desk / Reactive** | 10-15 (Tier 1 & 2) | All | User-facing support |
| **Professional Services** | 2-3 (Projects, Implementation) | Senior engineers | Projects, design work |
| **Security** | 1-2 (Specialist) | Tier 2 engineers | Firewalls, EDR, compliance |
| **Cloud Services** | 1-2 (Cloud architect/engineer) | Tier 2 engineers | Cloud migrations, M365 |
| **Management & Support** | 4-5 (Managers, Admin, Sales) | — | Operations, sales, delivery |

## Critical Insight: Service Line Profitability Drives Growth

MSPs with **higher managed services mix (70%+)** are more profitable and scalable than those with **heavy help desk/break-fix focus (50%+)**. This is why successful MSPs:[2][1][4]

1. **Shift help desk to managed services**: Convert reactive tickets into proactive monitoring contracts
2. **Upsell backup & security**: Bundle high-margin services into managed packages
3. **Hire specialists, not generalists**: Security and cloud experts command premium pricing
4. **Minimize break-fix work**: It's low-margin and burns labor hours quickly

**Your £750k EBITDA MSP should target**:[2]
- 35-40% from Managed Services (core revenue, recurring, scalable)
- 20-25% from Help Desk / Reactive (necessary but lower margin)
- 15-20% from Professional Services (project work, higher ticket value)
- 10-15% from Backup/DR + Security (high margin, growing demand)
- 5-10% from Cloud Services (emerging high-value segment)

This mix optimizes for both **recurring revenue stability (MRR) and profitability (20%+ EBITDA margin)**.[1][2][4]
