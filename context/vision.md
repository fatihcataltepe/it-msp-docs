## AI-Native MSP Roll-Up: Operating Vision & Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Acquisition, Onboarding, and Platform Unification

Establish a repeatable acquisition and integration engine for managed service providers. Standardize documentation, data models, and operating procedures during migration onto a unified platform. Eliminate operational variance by consolidating core support functions and enforcing common tooling, security baselines, and service definitions.

Continuously measure post-integration performance, feed learnings back into the onboarding playbook, and incrementally automate integration workflows to reduce time-to-value and dependency on manual intervention.

### Phase 2: Reactive Operations Automation

Systematically automate incident handling across the full ticket lifecycle:

* **Context Gathering**
  AI-driven contextual data collection from users and devices to enable accurate and automated ticket triage.

* **Deep System Enrichment**
  Automatically correlate tickets with identity, device, and configuration data across RMM, Azure AD, Intune, MDM, and related control planes.

* **Intelligent Classification & Routing**
  Use AI agents to categorize, prioritize, and route incidents with no human involvement.

* **Deterministic Auto-Remediation**
  Execute pre-validated remediation playbooks autonomously where confidence thresholds are met.

* **Human-in-the-Loop Augmentation**
  Provide AI copilots for complex investigations requiring judgment, escalation, or customer communication.

### Phase 3: Proactive & Preventative Operations

Transition from reactive support to prevention-led service delivery. Introduce self-service workflows and automated fixes for common user issues. Use AI-derived insights to continuously tune monitoring, alerting, and detection logic—reducing noise while improving signal quality and mean time to resolution.

---

### Phase 4: Proprietary Managed Services & Value Expansion

Build vertically integrated, AI-native managed services optimized for the standardized platform. Deliver differentiated offerings that improve client outcomes, increase switching costs, and expand margin through software-driven service leverage.

---

**End State:**
A scaled MSP platform where marginal growth is driven primarily by software, not headcount—enabling faster integrations, lower operating costs, and defensible service differentiation.
